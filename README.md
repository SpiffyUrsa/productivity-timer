# productivity-timer

## Description

A productivity timer that is designed to help enhance a user's time management using the pomodoro technique. The user can decide how long they want to do a task (session), and then also determine how long their break will be. The timer automatically switches between both modes allowing the user to focus on the task at hand without having to keep track of the time on their own.

## Running the client

In the root directory run `npm install` followed by `npm start` to open the application.
